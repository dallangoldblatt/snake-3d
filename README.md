# snake-3d
3-dimensional version of the popular computer game.

# Starting the game

Compile and run:

  `javac Snake3D.java`
  
  `java Snake3D`

# Playing the game

Control movement in the same color plane using `W`, `S`, `A`, and `D` for up, down, left, and right respectively.

Change planes using `Q` and `E`. 

Eating white dots increases the size of the snake. Running into the edge of the map or the body of the snake ends the game.
